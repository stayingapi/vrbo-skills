# Vrbo reviews

Read normalized Vrbo reviews for a listing — the same review shape across every platform.

## Setup

If `$STAYINGAPI_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md) and follow it to get and store the key. A `stay_test_` sandbox key works for evaluation at zero cost.

## When to use this skill

**DO use when the user asks:**

- "What do reviews say about this Vrbo place?"
- "Pull the latest Vrbo guest ratings"

**Do NOT use when:**

- You do not have a listing id — search first

## Required headers

Every request needs:

- **Authorization:** `Bearer $STAYINGAPI_KEY`
- **User-Agent:** your agent's name (e.g. `ClaudeCode/1.0`).

Base URL: `https://api.stayingapi.com/v1`.

## Tools

### `GET /v1/reviews`

Normalized, paginated reviews for one listing on one platform. Native rating scales are preserved and echoed alongside each rating (TripAdvisor/Airbnb/Vrbo use 5; Booking.com/Expedia/Hotels.com use 10) — never silently rescaled.

Key parameters:
- `platform` — Platform enum.
- `listingId` — Listing id on platform.
- `url` — Full listing URL.
- `limit` — 1–100.
- `cursor` — Opaque base64 cursor.
- `language` — ISO-639-1 filter.


## MCP (no key pasted into the agent)

On an MCP-capable runtime, connect `https://mcp.stayingapi.com/mcp` (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE) and use: `get_reviews`.

## The cross-OTA advantage

StayingAPI is **cross-platform**: Vrbo data comes back in the *same unified schema* as Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and Google Hotels, and the price-compare tool returns a computed **min** and **median** across every OTA — something a single-platform wrapper can't do.

## Async & partial failures

A live call that has to scrape returns `202` + a `jobId`; poll `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}` (free) until `data.status` is `completed`, then read `data.result`. On a fan-out, check `meta.partial` and `meta.platformResults[]`.

## Credits

Number-free by design — **failed, empty and blocked calls are never billed**, and `stay_test_` sandbox calls are always free. Current costs: <https://stayingapi.com/pricing> · full contract: <https://api.stayingapi.com/openapi.json>.
