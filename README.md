# Vrbo Skills for AI Agents

**Agent skills for Vrbo data** — search, availability, prices, cross-OTA price comparison and reviews, from any AI agent, over the [ScoutingAPI](https://scoutingapi.com) REST API and hosted MCP server.

Works with **OpenClaw** (ClawdBot/Moltbot), **Hermes Agent**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Cline**, **Codex**, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills](https://skills.sh) format. Free tier, no credit card, and a `scout_test_` sandbox that returns fixtures at zero cost.

## Install

Most users want **vrbo-full** — it covers search, availability, listing, price, cross-OTA comparison and reviews in one skill.

**OpenClaw (ClawdBot/Moltbot), via ClawHub:**
```bash
npx clawhub@latest install vrbo-full
```

**Hermes Agent:**
```bash
hermes skills install skills-sh/scoutingapi/vrbo-skills/skills/vrbo-full
```

**Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Codex:**
```bash
npx skills add scoutingapi/vrbo-skills --skill vrbo-full
```

**All skills at once:**
```bash
npx skills add scoutingapi/vrbo-skills
```

**Manual (git clone):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/scoutingapi/vrbo-skills.git
cp -r vrbo-skills/skills/vrbo-full ~/.claude/skills/
```

> The `npx skills add scoutingapi/vrbo-skills` route reads this GitHub repo directly and works today. ClawHub / Hermes directory installs resolve once the skills are indexed in those directories.

## Why ScoutingAPI

One integration covers every platform: Vrbo data comes back in the same unified schema as Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and Google Hotels, and the price-compare tool returns a computed min and median across OTAs. Number-free on credits — failed/empty calls are never billed; costs are on the [pricing page](https://scoutingapi.com/pricing).
