# Vrbo availability

Check day-by-day availability for a known Vrbo listing — the booking calendar over any date window.

## Setup

If `$SCOUTINGAPI_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md) and follow it to get and store the key. A `scout_test_` sandbox key works for evaluation at zero cost.

## When to use this skill

**DO use when the user asks:**

- "Is this Vrbo listing free the first week of August?"
- "Show the calendar for this Vrbo place"

**Do NOT use when:**

- You do not yet have a listing id — search first
- The user wants a price, not open/closed dates — use the prices skill

## Required headers

Every request needs:

- **Authorization:** `Bearer $SCOUTINGAPI_KEY`
- **User-Agent:** your agent's name (e.g. `ClaudeCode/1.0`).

Base URL: `https://api.scoutingapi.com/v1`.

## Tools

### `GET /v1/availability`

Get day-by-day availability for a known listing (or a batch of listings) on one platform over a date window. Each day reports whether it is available, its minimum-night requirement, and whether check-in / check-out / booking is allowed.

Key parameters:
- `platform` — Single platform (not a fan-out endpoint).
- `listingId` — A single listing id on platform.
- `listingIds[]` — A batch of listing ids on platform.
- `url` — Full listing URL (alternative to an id).
- `startDate` — YYYY-MM-DD; not in the past.
- `endDate` — After startDate; window ≤ 365 days.


## MCP (no key pasted into the agent)

On an MCP-capable runtime, connect `https://mcp.scoutingapi.com` (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE) and use: `check_availability`.

## The cross-OTA advantage

ScoutingAPI is **cross-platform**: Vrbo data comes back in the *same unified schema* as Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and Google Hotels, and the price-compare tool returns a computed **min** and **median** across every OTA — something a single-platform wrapper can't do.

## Async & partial failures

A live call that has to scrape returns `202` + a `jobId`; poll `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}` (free) until `data.status` is `completed`, then read `data.result`. On a fan-out, check `meta.partial` and `meta.platformResults[]`.

## Credits

Number-free by design — **failed, empty and blocked calls are never billed**, and `scout_test_` sandbox calls are always free. Current costs: <https://scoutingapi.com/pricing> · full contract: <https://api.scoutingapi.com/openapi.json>.
