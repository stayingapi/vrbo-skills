# Vrbo prices & cross-OTA comparison

Get a real Vrbo price quote — and, because ScoutingAPI is cross-platform, compare the same property across OTAs for the cheapest rate with a computed min and median.

## Setup

If `$SCOUTINGAPI_KEY` is not set, read [references/auth-setup.md](references/auth-setup.md) and follow it to get and store the key. A `scout_test_` sandbox key works for evaluation at zero cost.

## When to use this skill

**DO use when the user asks:**

- "How much is this Vrbo listing for these dates?"
- "Is this Vrbo place cheaper on another site?"

**Do NOT use when:**

- The user wants a list of options — use the search skill

## Required headers

Every request needs:

- **Authorization:** `Bearer $SCOUTINGAPI_KEY`
- **User-Agent:** your agent's name (e.g. `ClaudeCode/1.0`).

Base URL: `https://api.scoutingapi.com/v1`.

## Tools

### `GET /v1/price`

Quote one listing for specific dates and occupancy. Pass the platform-native platformListingId returned by /v1/search — numeric on Airbnb and Vrbo, a slug string on Booking.com and Google (e.g. "abramovic2") — or a full listing URL. The response is always a real numeric price or a typed error — never a wrong property's price.

Key parameters:
- `platform` — vrbo | booking | airbnb | google.
- `listingId` — Platform-native id from /v1/search platformListingId — numeric (Airbnb/Vrbo) or a slug string (Booking.com/Google). Or pass a url.
- `checkIn` — YYYY-MM-DD; not in the past.
- `checkOut` — Must be after checkIn.
- `adults` — ≥ 1.
- `children` — ≥ 0.

### `GET /v1/price-compare`

Compare the price of one property across booking platforms in a single call, resolved through the Google Hotels backbone. The response carries the offers plus ScoutingAPI-computed min and median as first-class fields, so you can read the cheapest and typical cross-OTA price without re-deriving them. No cross-platform short-term-rental price-comparison API exists elsewhere — this is the wedge.

Key parameters:
- `name` — Property name to resolve.
- `googleHotelId` — Precise Google Hotels id.
- `location` — Disambiguating place / "lat,lng".
- `checkIn` — YYYY-MM-DD; not in the past.
- `checkOut` — Must be after checkIn.
- `adults` — ≥ 1.


## MCP (no key pasted into the agent)

On an MCP-capable runtime, connect `https://mcp.scoutingapi.com` (OAuth 2.1 + PKCE) and use: `get_price`, `compare_prices`.

## The cross-OTA advantage

ScoutingAPI is **cross-platform**: Vrbo data comes back in the *same unified schema* as Airbnb, Booking.com, Vrbo and Google Hotels, and the price-compare tool returns a computed **min** and **median** across every OTA — something a single-platform wrapper can't do.

## Async & partial failures

A live call that has to scrape returns `202` + a `jobId`; poll `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}` (free) until `data.status` is `completed`, then read `data.result`. On a fan-out, check `meta.partial` and `meta.platformResults[]`.

## Credits

Number-free by design — **failed, empty and blocked calls are never billed**, and `scout_test_` sandbox calls are always free. Current costs: <https://scoutingapi.com/pricing> · full contract: <https://api.scoutingapi.com/openapi.json>.
